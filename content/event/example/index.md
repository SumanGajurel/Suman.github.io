summary: Modelling and diagnosing soil constraints using readily available datasets
abstract: 'Effective soil management is critical for sustainable agriculture, yet traditional methods for assessing soil properties are costly and time-consuming. This talk explores the use of process based model and machine learning to predict essential soil physical and chemical properties, such as plant availabel water capacity (PAWC), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and chloride levels, using readily availabel datasets. I will compare the predictive performance of several models, highlighting how the chosen approach provides a cost-effective solution for accurate soil properties prediction. Attendees will gain insights into model selection and application to identify soil constraints which provides informed farm management decisions, relevant to both research and on-ground agricultural practices."'
