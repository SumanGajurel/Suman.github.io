abstract: Soil chemical properties are crucial for farm management but traditional analysis is labor-intensive and costly. This study employed a Cubist machine learning approach to predict key soil properties (pH, chloride, EC, ECEC, and ESP) using data such as geographic location, soil texture, and crop yield across one-meter depth. The model showed moderate to good accuracy, with CCC values ranging from 0.93 for ECEC to 0.40 for ESP. These predictions provide valuable insights for stakeholders to make informed decisions on soil management. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study used a Cubist machine learning model to predict key soil chemical properties, achieving moderate to good accuracy, offering a faster, cost-effective alternative to traditional soil analysis for better farm management decisions.
