## Newsletter Soil CRC - Modelling a better future for agriculture

My journey from Nepal to Australia as detailed in a newsletter published on the Soil CRC website:

### Meet Suman Gajurel

Growing up in a rice-farming family in Nepal, I witnessed firsthand how small changes in farming practices could significantly impact productivity and livelihoods. The resilience and hard work of my grandparents and parents, despite the challenges of subsistence farming, deeply moved me and sparked my passion for agricultural science.

“Stemming from my childhood experiences, I became particularly interested in understanding how scientific advancements and technological innovations can improve traditional farming methods,” I said.

“The potential to enhance crop yield, manage diseases, and optimize resource use through agronomy and environmental science is incredibly motivating.”

This drive led me to pursue higher education in agriculture, where I focused on cutting-edge topics like digital soil mapping, geostatistics, and machine learning for soil modeling.

In 2019, I moved to Western Australia to start a Master of Science in Agriculture at Curtin University. It was during my Master’s research that I came across a Soil CRC PhD scholarship that aligned with my interests and decided to embark on my next big challenge.

“My PhD was based at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) and focused on modeling and diagnosing multiple soil constraints across Australia using existing datasets,” I said.

“This research contributed to a Soil CRC project led by Dr. Keith Pembleton at USQ and led to the development of a data-centric diagnostic framework that can diagnose soil Plant Available Water Capacity (PAWC).

“This tells us about the water-related soil constraints present in the field using farm management data, soil properties, crop observed yield, and APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) software,” I explained.

“I also built models that can predict soil chemical and physical properties to help us identify soil constraints present in the field using a machine learning approach.”

Once the framework and models are available as software or web-based tools, I believe they will be invaluable for both farmers and researchers.

“These tools will help diagnose soil chemical and physical constraints cost-effectively, enabling more informed and efficient soil and agricultural management practices,” I said.

When asked what I am most proud of, I highlighted the PAWC prediction framework I and the project team created.

“This framework has the capacity to predict PAWC across different soil and climatic conditions, providing valuable insights for farmers and researchers. This achievement not only represents a significant advancement in soil science but also has practical applications in improving agricultural practices,” I said.

“I am also really proud of my journey from Nepal to Australia to pursue higher education in agriculture. Adapting to a new country and excelling in my studies has been a personal achievement that has broadened my horizons and strengthened my commitment to making a positive impact in the field of agriculture.”

I said the possibility of contributing to sustainable agriculture and making a tangible difference in the lives of farmers around the world continues to inspire me and drive me forward.

I am currently working as a casual research assistant at the University of Southern Queensland, where I am involved in a sesame crop modeling project with AgriFutures Australia.

“I’m keen to take on full-time work in the field of agricultural and environmental modeling, particularly in roles that focus on developing and implementing predictive models to enhance crop production and sustainable agricultural practices.

“My goal is to contribute to innovative research and practical applications that can address the challenges facing modern agriculture,” I said.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and reading books.

“Traveling allows me to explore new cultures and landscapes, which broadens my perspective and inspires my work. While reading provides me with a wealth of knowledge and ideas that fuel my passion for agricultural science and other interests,” I said.

“Both hobbies enrich my life and contribute to my personal and professional growth.”
